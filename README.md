## About the Indicator
As for Indicator Weather, the indicator itself is rather simple. It's a python script that exports a Gtk
menu over DBus. To start the script there is an Upstart config file located at indicator/indicator-upower.service. This starts the indicator when
Unity starts the rest of the indicators. The other important file is
indicator/upower.indicator. This file lets Unity know where to
find the indicator on DBus and where to place the indicator on the indicator bar.

If you are interested in creating your own indicator for Ubuntu Touch and have
questions, I would be glad to help.
